Day 1: #Day1withPriya #366daychallenge 
Interviewer: Why do you prefer to work on libraries than frameworks.

Let's deep dive:
1. Tailored Solutions: Libraries offer specific tools for particular tasks, allowing me to choose only what's needed for a project without adopting a whole set of rules from a framework.
2. Flexibility and Freedom: Using libraries provides flexibility as I can mix and match different tools as per project requirements, giving me more control over how I build.
3. Customization Power: Working with libraries allows me to customize and fine-tune functionalities to fit precisely into a project, tailoring solutions to unique needs.
4. Integration Ease: Libraries seamlessly integrate into different projects and environments, making it simpler to work with diverse technologies and setups.
5. Deep Understanding of Components: Using libraries helps me understand specific components in-depth, aiding in efficient utilization and boosting my expertise in handling varied tools.

Day 2:
Interviewer: Why do you prefer React over other libraries and frameworks.
Let's deep dive:
1.Component-Based Architecture: Encourages the creation of reusable and independent UI components.
2.Virtual DOM: Utilizes a virtual representation of the DOM for efficient updates, enhancing performance.
3.JSX (JavaScript XML): Integrates HTML-like syntax within JavaScript, simplifying the creation of UI elements.
4. Unidirectional Data Flow: Ensures a clear flow of data downward, enhancing application predictability.
5.State Management: Offers options like Redux or React Context for efficient state management across components.
6.Vibrant Community: Benefits from an active community providing extensive resources, libraries, and tools.
7.Performance Optimization: Minimizes direct DOM manipulation, leading to better performance.
8.Developer Tools: Provides robust tools like React DevTools for effective debugging and component inspection.
9.Versatility and Backing: Supports web and mobile app development (React Native) and is maintained by Facebook, ensuring ongoing support and updates.

Day 3:
Interviewer: How can you add 2 different colors at the alternative rows in a html table.
Let's deep dive:

The question aims to evaluate your familiarity with CSS properties, particularly the nth-child pseudo-class, and how effectively you can apply this 
knowledge to achieve a specific visual effect, such as alternating row colors in a table. It also assesses your understanding of HTML structure, as 
you might need to explain the relationship between HTML elements and the corresponding CSS selectors.

:nth-child is a CSS pseudo-class that allows you to select elements based on their position within a parent element. It is used to target elements 
that match a specific pattern defined by a formula.

For instance:
:nth-child(2n) selects every even element.
:nth-child(2n+1) selects every odd element.
:nth-child(3) selects every third element.
:nth-child(3n+1) selects elements whose position is 1 more than a multiple of 3, starting from the first element.
:nth-child(odd) is a keyword equivalent to :nth-child(2n+1).
:nth-child(even) is a keyword equivalent to :nth-child(2n).
